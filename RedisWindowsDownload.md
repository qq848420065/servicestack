# Getting Started #

Due to the popularity and simplicity of the Redis protocol there is a plethora of different Redis clients bindings for almost every popular language in use today.

For .NET applications you can download and get started with [ServiceStack's C# Redis client library](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis) - which can also be used on Linux platforms using [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page).

For Java applications the most active library at the moment is [JRedis](http://code.google.com/p/jredis/). For all other language bindings visit the [redis supported languages page](http://redis.io/clients).
